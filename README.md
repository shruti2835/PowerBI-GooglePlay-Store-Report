# PowerBI-GooglePlay-Store-Report

This is a PowerBI report that I have created for the Google Play Store Apps Analysis. The dataset for this report is taken from Kaggle. 
I have used different visualizations like the pie chart, donut chart, bar graph and rating chart for visualising the data and analysing the results. 
I have uploaded the PowerBI report and also some .png images of my visualisations.
